#Exclusive common numbers.
#Generate 2 lists with the length of 10 with random integers from 1 to 10, and
#make a third list containing the common integers between the 2 initial lists without any duplicates.
#Constraints: use only while loop and random module to generate numbers

#Find the common numbers. Between 1-20 in this case.
